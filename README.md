## Installation

### Binaries

TODO!

### Development

You need to have [Cython](https://cython.org/) installed.
Then:

```shell
pip install cython
git clone git@github.com:fgnt/meeteval.git
pip install -e ./meeteval
```

## Computing WERs

`MeetEval` supports [Segmental Time Mark](https://github.com/usnistgov/SCTK/blob/master/doc/infmts.htm#L75) (`STM`) files as input.
Each line in an `STM` file represents one "utterance" and is defined as

```STM
STM :== <filename> <channel> <speaker_id> <begin_time> <end_time> <transcript>
```
e.g.
```
recording1 0 Alice 0 0 Hello Bob.
recording1 0 Bob 1 0 Hello Alice.
recording1 0 Alice 2 0 How are you?
...
recording2 0 Alice 0 0 Hello Carol.
...
```
where
- `filename`: name of the recording
- `channel`: ignored
- `speaker_id`: ID of the speaker or system output stream/channel (not microphone channel)
- `begin_time`: in seconds, used to find the order of the utterances (can also be an int counter)
- `end_time`: in seconds (currently ignored)
- `transcript`: space-separated list of words

An example `STM` file can be found in [the example_files](example_files/ref.stm).

We chose the `STM` format as the default because it contains all information required to compute the cpWER, ORC WER and MIMO WER.
`MeetEval` currently does not support use of detailed timing information, so `begin_time` is only used to determine the correct utterance order and `end_time` is ignored.
This may change in future versions.
The speaker-ID field in the hypothesis encodes the output channel for MIMO and ORC WER.
Once you created an `STM` file, the tool can be called like this:

```shell
meeteval-wer -h example_files/hyp.stm -r example_files/ref.stm --orc --mimo --cp
```

The switches `--orc`, `--mimo` and `--cp` allow selecting the WER definition to use.
Multiple definitions can be selected simultaneously.

The MIMO WER and efficient implementation of ORC WER are presented in the paper "On Word Error Rate Definitions and
their Efficient Computation for Multi-Speaker Speech Recognition Systems".
